  <h2> 
   About me: 
  </h2>
  I'm a computer engineer student at UFG and I have interest in web development. I started in a junior enterprise, where all the collaborators were students just like me. I was able to know more about software development and more, customer contact and teamwork. We are incapable of making great achievements without teamwork. Besides that, I also participated a learning program, Acelera ZG, where I had a great learning about backend and frontend web. At the end of the program, I was hired as a intern, where I learned a lot for a couple months.
